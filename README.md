Hi 👋 I'm Nico and obviously the last, commonly known-about Yedi. 

I'm a developer mainly in C# with broad knowledge of ASP.NET Core, EF Core and WPF.  
Besides that it's just a bit C++ on my ol' reliable ESP32 and bits of LUA.

Besides that;
- born '9️⃣9️⃣ in the ✨ Schnitzel kingdom ✨ (austria btw.)
- loves bikes 🏍️
- loves skiing ⛷️
- kinda crazy for photography 📸
- would literally die for fluffy cats 😺
- obviously loves coding 👨‍💻
